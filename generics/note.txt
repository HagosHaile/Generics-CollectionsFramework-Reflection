Lower bound wildcards
	List<? super T>
	
	you can not read items from a List<? super T> because you can not guarantee what 
	list it is really pointing to we can read Objects exclusively.
	
	
	We can insert sub types of T into a List<? super T>

upper bound wildcards
	List<? extends T>
	You can read but not insert in upper bound wildcards
	
	
Serializable
	is a marker interface with no abstract method.
	
	serialization is the process of saving an object's state to a sequence of bytes
	
	deserialization is the process of reconstructing an object from those bytes. 
	
	Generally, the complete process is called serialization
	
	Only Classes That Implement Serializable Can Be Serialized
	
	
The Transient and Static Fields Do Not Get Serialized
	If we want to serialize one object but do not want to serialize specific fields,
	then we can mark those fields as transient.

	All the static fields belong to the class instead of the object, 
	and the serialization process serializes the object so static fields can not be serialized.
