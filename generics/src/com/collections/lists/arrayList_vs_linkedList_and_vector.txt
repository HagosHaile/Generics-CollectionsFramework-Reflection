								ArrayList		doubly linked List
1. insertion at the beginning						better
2. insertion at the end			takes approximately the same for both(
								but array is a little bit better because 
								doubly linked list has this extra 
								address update)
								

Vector
	-under the hood Vector also uses one dimensional array like ArrayList.
	-drawback is though we have to know the size of the underlaying
	one dimensional array at compile time.
	-Vectors are synchronized by default but we have to aquire the lock before the update 
	and release after every update which means it is very expensive operation
	-In general DONT USE IT!!!!
