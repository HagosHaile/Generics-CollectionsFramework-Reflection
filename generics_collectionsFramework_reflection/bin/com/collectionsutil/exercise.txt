Design a class that acts as a cache for the following feature(s):

whenever the user searches for a web address 
(www.google.com or www.facebook.com) 
first we have to check whether it is present in the cache or not

of course we have to track recently visited websites as well

for example we use a data structure with capacity 5 - 
it means we track 5 websites exclusively

the recently visited websites are stored in some part of the data structure 
- it depends on what concrete class you use :)

provide one version of the class that uses generics. 
Again you are allowed to use any built-in data structures 
to store and retrieve the data (for example for the cache).
