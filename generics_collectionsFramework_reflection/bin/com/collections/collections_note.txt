Java collections framework
	The Java collections framework is a set of classes and interfaces that implement 
	commonly reusable collection data structures.

	Although referred to as a framework, it works in a manner of a library. 
	The collections framework provides both interfaces that define various collections and 
	classes that implement them.
	
	
Data structure 
	-is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables 
	efficient access and modification.
	-More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, 
	the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data
	i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data.
